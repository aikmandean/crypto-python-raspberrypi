# Solving the Crytpto Python 3.5 Problem
  
Difficulty: ⭐️  
Utility: ⭐️⭐️⭐️  
  
This repo enables raspberrypi devices on older software to utilize python 3.5 in conjunction with an API that updates every 15 minutes. The original codebase is credited in the license in the root directory of this repo. This is a simple project for anyone with a basic grasp of programming. Downcasting, or rewriting a codebase for an older platform or set of constraints, is not difficult, but serves a real-world, practical purpose.
